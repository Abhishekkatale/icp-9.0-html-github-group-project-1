    <h1>Hostel Info and Admission</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>
        <i>A hostel is a form of low-cost, short-term shared sociable lodging where guests can rent a bed, usually a bunk bed in a dormitory sleeping 4â€“20 people, with shared use of a lounge and usually a kitchen. Rooms can be mixed or single and have private or shared bathrooms. Private rooms may also be available. Hostels are popular forms of lodging for backpackers,however very few impose age limits, so hostels are an option for travellers of all ages and styles. The benefits of hostels include lower costs and opportunities to meet people from different places, find travel partners, and share travel experiences. Some hostels, such as in India or Hostelling International, cater to a niche market of travelers. Different hostels can be known for offering different experiences. For example, one hostel might feature in-house social gatherings such as movie nights or communal dinners, another might feature local tours, one might be known for its parties.
